# Facebook
This is a second year final project.
In this project I created a social network for the console that simulates "Facebook".
The project manages files in which it saves the information written to it.
You can enjoy a variety of options such as: adding a user to the system, uploading different types of statuses,
linking and canceling friendships between people and between business pages, printing information as needed, and more..
The project was written in C++ language.
